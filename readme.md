# Verify Account UI

Verify account UI is a simple UI designed with html, css and javascript. In this app we simply ask a user to enter a 6 digit code which we sent to their email address! But actually we dont sent any email, its just a design. this UI is an idea which we can use in our real-world projects. This project is an inspiration from Brad Traversy's 50projects50days challenge.
